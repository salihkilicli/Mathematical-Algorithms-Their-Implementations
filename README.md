# Mathematical-Algorithms-and-Their-Implementations

My personal solutions for the projects given in the Mathematical version of the Algorithms &amp; Data Structures Ph.D. course. The course is given under the name of MATH 679: Mathematical Algorithms and Their Implementations, and part of the notebooks are given by the instructor and the TA of the course.
